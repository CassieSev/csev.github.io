Cassie Sevilla is a Ph.D. student at Cornell University!  I am studying within the field of time-domain optical astronomy, with a focus on Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients.  I am involved with collaborations on the Zwicky Transient Facility, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite, and the future Ultraviolet Explorer.
