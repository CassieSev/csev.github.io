### Research Interests

I currently study extragalactic transients within the field of time-domain astronomy, with a focus on Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs).  LFBOTs are extragalactic transients with similar absolute magnitude as bright supernovae, but with a much faster evolution.

While we typically discover LFBOTs through optical surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, they also exhibit emission all throughout the electromagnetic spectrum.  So, I end up using all sorts of facilities like the Very Large Array and SWIFT.

This combination of characteristics has been very tough to explain, with all sorts of proposed theories thrown around.  The plan for my thesis is to use the coming advancements in time-domain astronomy to figure this mystery out!

### Miscellaneous

I am a *very* avid board gamer.  Some of my favorites to play are _Terraforming Mars_, _Ark Nova_, and _Dune: Imperium_.

I also love video games, with a focus on rogue-lites and souls-like games.

I am unfortunately not a music conossieur, but I must confess to a soft spot for Vocaloid (and other vocal synths)
